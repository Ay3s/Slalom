# Slalom

This is explanation of "what to do".



You start with creating your gates by clicking "Začít kreslení dráhy" button. Then by clicking in the free space you will create gates. You can put as many gates as you want. After you are finished with gates, you then click "Ukončit kreslení dráhy" (the button is on the same place as was the "Začít kreslení dráhy". If you want to start from scratch, click "Reset branek" button and all gates will be deleted.

To start racing, you need to click on the "Začít závod" button. The algorithm will choose the gates to define the track and you are ready to go. You will be displayed as black dot starting from the top. To reach finish, you need to go around the red/blue gates. You need to bypass the red gate from the left and the blue gate from the right.

If you run into the gate, bypass the gate from the wrong side or go out of the track, your run will end and time will reset. You will be put again on the top of the track and you can try again.

If not, you finished your run and message box will be displayed with the time it took you to reach the finish line. If you want to start again, just click "Start závodníka".
